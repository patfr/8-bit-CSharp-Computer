# 8-bit-C-Computer
This is a simple C# 8-bit computer i made for fun.

You need to understand Assembly, C# and Python for you to understand how this computer works.
The computer is writen in C# and i made a custom compiler for my computers Assembly made in Python.

files for the computer:
-main.cs,
-Cpu.cs,
-Ram.cs,
-Rom.cs,
-Stack.cs.

files for the compiler:
-main.py,
-compiler.py.

how to use:
to run the computer run the main.cs file.
to run the compiler run the main.py.

When you run the compiler it will output a file called "Compiled.txt" this file will contain the compiled program.
To run the program insert the text from the "Compiled.txt" into the Rom.cs file inbetween "// Program starts here" and "// The program ends here" comments.
List of instructions is in the "Commands.txt"
